                As the material conditions of the world continue to degrade and politics become stultified and frustrating, mainline and established media publications fail to embody the rage, disillusion and ideals of an increasingly radicalized digital space.

            <p>
                La Jeunesse strives to be a dedicated Marxist publication that can better embody the frustrations and priorities of the wide range of developing Communists and Socialists.

            <p>
                We aim not just to make glib commentary about global empire in collapse and the farce it creates, though we will absolutely do that, we also aim to root materialist criticism and Marxist theory honestly in the frustration and experience of the moment.

                One of the core messages we seek to impart is that for those pushed to more radical forms of thought and anger, you are not alone. More people feel as you feel everyday, as neoliberal hegemony degrades at the seams, more people are pushed and pushed towards the alternatives.

                    I often joke that regardless of what economic system we live under, I will still be an accountant. If, suddenly, the company I work for was changed overnight into an employee-owned enterprise, very little of my day-to-day life would change. What socialism means to me is not personal escape from what is a fairly comfortable reality, but the end of an economic class that has, until my current position, tortured myself and others with their existence: the modern Jeffersonian small holder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The original Jeffersonian small holder was a farmer, a yeoman farmer who would own and work a small plot of land and uphold Republicanism. But it’s not just farmers using migrant labor I oppose but also all the various small business tyrants: the franchisee, the law and accounting partners, and the multitude of other small businesses that mistreat their workers in the pursuit of profit for their owners and their financiers. Socialism would mean a world where all enjoy the luxuries I take for granted: healthcare, education, food security, and a dignified retirement.

                    The more you read history, the more you feel that we are doomed to repeat it; socialism — to me — is the hope that we will not. All throughout history, humanity has suffered under exploitation and violence, vast and pointless cycles that seemed doomed to repeat themselves. But socialism is the hope that — despite all evidence to the contrary — humanity can be better than we have been. That we can cast off the chains that have weighed us down since the first kings put on their crowns. The hope that if we work together, we can build a future that will remember our current society as backward and primitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And this hope must be kept alive and shared, no matter how foolish it might seem.

                    Socialism, to me, prefigures the ultimate goal that those who came before us were always reaching for: total liberation, in allowing for anybody to experience the fullest extent of their life irrespective of their ability or means.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even assuming it isn't just a caprice born of desire to be part of a subversive counterculture and an infatuation with Soviet aesthetics, the rampant injustice ruling the world you live in makes it difficult to not become obsessed with saving it from it's destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are largely only able to conceive of how to challenge everything about our present circumstances because they uncompromisingly committed to a struggle for human liberation that forced the world to reckon with these rebellious upstarts. They fought and fell for a world that they wanted to see, to be certain, but that fight was not contingent upon the gratification of being there for the product. It was as simple as recognizing the tremendous gap which existed between the present circumstances and refusing to accept it.

                    My family didn't grow up poor, but precarious. We had food and necessities but no exuberant luxury. Bills got very tight, money was a constant topic of stress in the family, causing endless arguments. I was always acutely aware of how razor-thin a family budget could be, even for a family that seems alright on the surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always been closely involved with labour in my life, I've been in unions or covered under collective bargaining before myself, and my family owes a lot of stability to a union card that my father held. Without the union, I definitely wouldn't have any of the quality of life that I have today. But it's clear to me that trade unionism alone is unprepared to take on the task of developing socialism.

                    Social conservatives have chosen to target queer, trans, and gay people and make them pawns in a culture war wherever they go. I don't really have a personal choice whether or not to engage in politics, it follows me wherever I turn. I've been fired from jobs for being a transgender woman, I've been mocked for it at the workplace. Socialism (and Communism, in particular) is the sole route to building power that is viable for our community because capital has the power to undermine all social activism into consumerism.

                    To me, the promise of socialism and the development of communism is the creation of a future free from the constraints and cruelty of capitalism. It is the promise for the working people to claim control of their lives and destinies. It is the power to build a brighter and more beautiful future built on cooperation rather than coercion. A future in which the homeless are housed, the hungry are fed, the sick are cared for and all enjoy pride and participation in their existence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the world breaks down around us and stultified structures of imperial and technological power decay, it is in the hands of the workers of the present and the future to see society remade. One that will allow for humanity to walk arm-in-arm from its present darkness mired by greed and misery and into the shining light of self-determined destiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quite simply, what socialism means to me, is a world in which it is kindness and compassion that may replace the reign of avarice and cruelty.
